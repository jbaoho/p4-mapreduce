Project AI Assistance Summary
================================

Tools & Services
----------------
- OpenAI ChatGPT (Codex CLI agent) assisted with code design, implementation, lint cleanup, and test guidance for the MapReduce manager/worker project.

Scope of Assistance
-------------------
1. Implemented the word-count reducer placeholder in `tests/testdata/exec/wc_reduce.py`.
2. Authored the `bin/mapreduce` init script to manage manager/worker daemons (start/stop/status/restart).
3. Replaced the stubbed MapReduce Manager with a full implementation:
   - Job queueing, mapper/reducer task orchestration.
   - Worker registration, heartbeat monitoring, and fault tolerance.
   - Shared temporary directory management.
4. Implemented the Worker process:
   - Registration/heartbeat logic.
  - Map task execution (streaming mapper output, partitioning, sorting).
   - Reduce task execution (merging inputs, invoking reducers).
5. Resolved lint/style issues (pycodestyle, pylint) by restructuring code, adding shared TCP helpers, and adjusting imports/configuration.
6. Ran and interpreted pytest suites; suggested additional end-to-end tests with provided scripts.
7. Produced this AI usage summary.

Human Oversight
---------------
- The repository owner reviewed code changes, ran local tests (pytest suites, style checks), and verified functionality.
- No production systems were deployed without manual confirmation.

Data & Privacy
--------------
- No proprietary or sensitive production data was shared with the AI assistant.
- Assistance relied solely on project code and public instructions.

Limitations
-----------
- Integration tests requiring unrestricted networking/filesystem access were suggested but not executed within the sandbox; manual verification is recommended.
